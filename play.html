            <h4>SCENE I. The sea-coast.</h4>
<p class="stage-direction">Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN</p>
<h6 class="name">ANTONIO</h6>
<p class="speech ANTONIO">Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?</p>

<h6 class="name">SEBASTIAN</h6>
<p class="speech SEBASTIAN">By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTONIO:</h6>
 <p class="speech ANTONIO">Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.</p>

<h6 class="name">SEBASTIAN</h6>
<p class="speech SEBASTIAN">No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
me in manners the rather to express myself. You
must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
which I called Roderigo. My father was that
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
for some hour before you took me from the breach of
the sea was my sister drowned.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTONIO</h6>
<p class="speech ANTONIO">Alas the day!</p>

<h6 class="name">SEBASTIAN</h6>
<p class="speech SEBASTIAN">A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
though I could not with such estimable wonder
overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTONIO</h6>
<p class="speech ANTONIO">Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.</p>

<h6 class="name">SEBASTIAN</h6>
<p class="speech SEBASTIAN">O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTONIO</h6>
<p class="speech ANTONIO">If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
your servant.</p>

<h6 class="name">SEBASTIAN</h6>
<p class="speech SEBASTIAN">If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">Exit</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTONIO</h6>
<p class="speech ANTONIO">The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
Else would I very shortly see thee there.
But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">Exit</p>
